			Salamu Aleykum! May there be peace and blessings upon all of you, whether you're reading this or not.
			Welcome to another news headline about another game in the Bright Future Summer League, here we are talking about
			the highest scoring game at the time of writing this: Detention FC VS Gooners FC.
			<br><br>
			This was a very lopsided game, with Detention FC taking the crown against Gooners FC with an unbelievable score
			of 13-4. It's almost like it was training day for Detention FC!

			The Man of the Match according to Helar Salar, the referee of the match, was Mahan Rostam, who scored a hat trick
			and assisted two goals. The reason for Helar's pick was because Mahan was a great team player with good morals,
			scored a hat trick and played with a clean record in the game.
			<br><br>
			The name after Mahan Rostam's name is Abdullah Kamiran, who scored two goals: one tap-in and one banger of a
			goal! From this game, he also managed to prove that he is, the one and only, top assister of the tournament. But
			who knows, maybe we'll get to see a new one!
			<br><br>
			The name after Abdullah Kamiran's name is Sharbel Bashar, who scored six goals! SIX GOALS!! A wonderful and shocking
			performance has been left by him in the history books of the 2024-2025 season, and we can't believe it either. If you'll
			ask, the reason why he wasn't picked to be the Man of the Match was because he was greedy most of the game and already
			had a card to his name in the match.
			<br><br>
			The name after Sharbel Bashar's name is Yousif Qusay, who scored a simple assisted goal at the bare edge of Gooners
			FC's box.
			<br><br>
			And finally, the last name in Detention FC's area in the chart is Mohammed Barwar, who scored a wonderful assisted goal
			with a powerful shot to the net.
			<br><br>
			From the point of view of Gooners FC, it wasn't a very great match. There weren't much passes going around and if you had
			watched them, you would've seen for yourself. Yet, we still got some good goals out of this match from Gooners FC.
			<br><br>
			The first name to appear in Gooners FC's area in the chart is Ali Mohammed, who scored the first goal of the game when
			Detention FC scored 5 goals. Ali Mohammed and Mahmood Ammar did a Tiki Taka kind of movement while progressing to the box, and
			Ali took the last shot.
			<br><br>
			The name after Ali Mohammed's name is Mahmood Ammar, who scored two goals, both of which were assisted.
			<br><br>
			And the last name in Gooners FC's area is Majid Abdul-Kareem, who scored a carefully calculated outside-the-box goal
			from a few inches away from the kickoff line at the top-middle of Detention FC's goal.
