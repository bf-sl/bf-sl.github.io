			The Man of the Match according to the referee of the match (Lewar Salar) has been awarded to
			Mahan Rostam, the hat trick hero of the game! With two individual goals to his name and an assist from
			Abdullah Kamiran, it'd be wrong to not put him as a man of the match!
			<br><br>
			The name after Mahan Rostam's name is Abdullah Kamiran, who scored an amazing tap in at the edge of
			the box. He went on to save the team from a close call for a loss.
			<br><br>
			The name after Abdullah Kamiran's name is Sharbel Bashar, who scored two individual goals effortlessly,
			as he basically glided past all the players of Kurd Stars FC.
			<br><br>
			And finally, the final column is Yousif Qusay's name, who scored an amazing outside-the-box goal to add to the
			scorline and seal the deal.
			<br><br>
			From the point of view for Kurd Stars FC, they were amazing in their play. Their defence was rock hard and a great
			contribution to their team. And their attack? Oh boy. They played a very solid game and even though they lost, they
			still did amazing.
			<br><br>
			The first name to appear in Kurd Stars FC's area in the chart is Shad Hindav, who scored an amazing header from an amazing
			cross from Mohammed Safar that went past anyone in his way. You'd think he was Cristiano Ronaldo the way he jumped to the ball!
			<br><br>
			The last name in Kurd Stars FC's area is the man himself, Mohammed Safar. Two wonderful assisted goals and one penalty to his name,
			as he saved his team from an embarrassing scoreline.
